Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory):
it follows two parts:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization

1. Authentication:
verifies your identity.
Before authorization.
in Azure: ADF, Synapse, or Databricks authenticates using Managed Identity or Azure AD token
eg, user, group

2. Authorization:
grants or restricts access to resources. Controls access and permissions.
After authentication.
in Azure: Then that identity is authorized via IAM role (like “Storage Blob Data Contributor”)
eg, Role

| 1️⃣  | **Authentication** | You swipe your access card at office gate → verifies your identity.             |
| 2️⃣  | **Authorization**  | The system checks your role — you can enter your floor but not the server room. |

Example:

When Azure Databricks connects to ADLS using a Managed Identity →
Authentication: Databricks proves its identity using the Managed Identity token.
Authorization: ADLS checks RBAC roles (e.g., Storage Blob Data Contributor) to decide if Databricks can read/write files.
