Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service.
it follows two parts:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization

1. Authentication:
verifies your identity.
Before authorization.
in Azure: ADF, Synapse, or Databricks authenticates using Managed Identity or Azure AD token
eg, user, group

2. Authorization:
grants or restricts access to resources. Controls access and permissions.
After authentication.
in Azure: Then that identity is authorized via IAM role (like “Storage Blob Data Contributor”)
eg, Role

| Step | Concept            | Example                                                                         |

| 1️⃣  | **Authentication** | You swipe your access card at office gate → verifies your identity.             |
| 2️⃣  | **Authorization**  | The system checks your role — you can enter your floor but not the server room. |

Example:

When Azure Databricks connects to ADLS using a Managed Identity →
Authentication: Databricks proves its identity using the Managed Identity token.
Authorization: ADLS checks RBAC roles (e.g., Storage Blob Data Contributor) to decide if Databricks can read/write files.

Users:
go to azure portal > search for Microsoft Entra ID >  click on Users from left menu > click on create new user

Concept:
when we want to communicate any resource with user then we have to assign roles to the user or group.
when we want to commnunicagte between any two azure resources then we have to create Managed Identity or Service Principal.

for user there is only role but for resource there are two options i.e. Managed Identity and Service Principal.
what is the difference between Managed Identity and Service Principal?
managed identity is used to establish connection between two azure services 
whereas as service principal is used to establish connection between an external service and azure cloud service.
Whether we create managed identity or service principal, under the hood azure will also create service principal.
In service principal, we need to rotate access key token for every 90 or 270 or 360 days to make it secure as well so that no other can access it.
But in Managed Identity, azure takes care of the access key token rotation, and we don't have to worry about its security as well.

there are two managed identity:
1.	System assigned managed identity
It is by default created when the resource is created and it is attached to its resource lifecycle.
2.	User assigned managed identity
It is created by user which can be used by multiple azure resources.
