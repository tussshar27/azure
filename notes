Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory):
it follows two parts:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization

1. Authentication:
verifies your identity.
Before authorization.
in Azure: ADF, Synapse, or Databricks authenticates using Managed Identity or Azure AD token
eg, user, group

2. Authorization:
grants or restricts access to resources. Controls access and permissions.
After authentication.
in Azure: Then that identity is authorized via IAM role (like “Storage Blob Data Contributor”)
eg, Role

| 1️⃣  | **Authentication** | You swipe your access card at office gate → verifies your identity.             |
| 2️⃣  | **Authorization**  | The system checks your role — you can enter your floor but not the server room. |

Example:

When Azure Databricks connects to ADLS using a Managed Identity →
Authentication: Databricks proves its identity using the Managed Identity token.
Authorization: ADLS checks RBAC roles (e.g., Storage Blob Data Contributor) to decide if Databricks can read/write files.

Users:
go to azure portal > search for Microsoft Entra ID >  click on Users from left menu > click on create new user

Concept:
when we want to communicate any resource through user then we have to assign roles to the user or group.
when we want to commnunicate between any two azure resources then we have to create Managed Identity or Service Principal.

RECHECK THE VIDEO- for user there is only role but for resource there are two options i.e. Managed Identity and Service Principal.
what is the difference between both?
In service principal, we need to rotate access key token for every 90 or 270 or 360 days to make it safer
But in Managed Identity, azure takes care of the access key token rotation, and we don't have to worry about it.
